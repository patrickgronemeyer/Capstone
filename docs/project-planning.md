Add all your project documentation into this markdown(md) file. Here you will add your Links, images, and/or PDF files. You do this by accessing your file explorer on your pc going to where you save the photos then dragging and dropping your photos/files into your docs Folder.

Note: It could be useful to create a separate pictures or img folder inside of your docs folder to collect and store images for your Homework and Capstone.
